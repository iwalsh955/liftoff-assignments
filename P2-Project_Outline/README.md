## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Include overview here

	Want to find if a certain item is in stock or not? Or be able to check a certain web page for changes in stock or price? My project is a tool to help people find
what they are looking for as well as keep tabs on their item avaliability and pricing. My project will goto a website url and scrape for data such as price and availability
in order to help people find when a item they want comes back into stock at an online store. 

	Users will find it usefull to help them keep track of where and when a certain product comes into stock or changes price, instead of having to keep checking a store every day 
manually wasting time and effort trying to see if any nearby stores have it in stock. The idea came from the trouble I have been having with finding an Xbox series X in stock at any store
and continually checking different sites every couple of days with no luck.
